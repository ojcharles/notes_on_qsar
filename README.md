# Notes and reference material on molecular modelling and QSAR

Oscar Charles 2023

This is a set of material that introduces QSAR molecular modelling concepts.

Notebooks:
 - 1 - Conceptual and light introduction to QSAR & modelling.
 - 2 - Discussion and comparison of types of molecular fingerprints and code to compare metrics in a LogP and HIV1 protase bioactivity datasets.
 - 3 - Comparison of fingerprints and ML algorithms, plus ensembles.
 - 4 - 


There will be a consistent toolset used in these notebooks:
    pandas numpy xgboost sklearn matplotlib rdkit deepchem mordred tensorflow scipy seaborn opencv-python umap-learn

The example data will come from CHEMBL:
    logp data source [CHEMBL635482](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/assay_report_card/CHEMBL635482)
